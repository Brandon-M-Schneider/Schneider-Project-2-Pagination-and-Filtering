# Schneider-Project-2-Pagination-and-Filtering
Program compiles a list of student records and applies pagination of the records so that 10 records are shown on a single page, and any overflow is appended to additional links at the bottom of the page based on the total number of records.

The user can filter their search results using the search function at the top of the page. Displayed pagination links are updated based on the number of results returned from the search function.

The user can return home and display all of the sites records with original pagination applied by clicking the "Home" button.

// Future Commits
- Change event listener  of search function to work with submit and keyup.
